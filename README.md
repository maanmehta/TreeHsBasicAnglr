# My Github Repository for Angular Basics course on Treehouse

## Testing code via Github project site
I have created a Github project site for this project and with that you can execute the code of this project by calling the main `index.html` file using the following URL:

https://maanmehta.github.io/TreeHsBasicAnglr/index.html

## Using Rawgit to test

RawGit serves raw files directly from GitHub with proper Content-Type headers. Therefore, you can test your static HTML, JavaScript (JS) and CSS code on Rawgit directly from your Github repository

1. To test your `index.html` on your `master` branch, test it like this:
https://rawgit.com/maanmehta/TreeHsBasicAnglr/master/

2. To test your `index.html` on your `work` branch, test it like this:
https://rawgit.com/maanmehta/TreeHsBasicAnglr/work/
